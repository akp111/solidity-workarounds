# solidity-workarounds

> Solidity is like life, sometimes you just have to fk it, you know, like dominate it—with workarounds.

This repo will casually go over some of things folks commonly want to do in Solidity—but are unable because the language is nascent—and detail some solutions to each of these issues.

Disclaimer: I'm literally a couple months into looking at Solidity myself and do not aim to write formal "best practices" solutions to any of these issues, these are just hacky solutions that have worked for me. **If you have better solutions or more issues/workarounds that you feel should be listed here, I encourage you to make a PR!**
